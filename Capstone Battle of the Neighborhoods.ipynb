    "\n",
    "Every summer, the influx of tourists for the festival season creates and incredible gridlock in the streets of Montreal. Much to the dismay of locals, very few people use the amazing public transport system to get from place to place, opting instead to drive around. I believe this is due to the lack of awareness of all the amazing restaurants, bars, theatres, and other points of interest that can easily be reached by subway in a matter of minutes."

    "### **B. Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Montreal local, I have seen it every summer. Droves of tourists clutter the streets of the city, as they try to drive a few blocks in rush-hour traffic. It always boggles the mind that they would opt to spend 20 minutes in downtown traffic, instead of jumping on the subway for a few stops and getting to their destination in relative tranquility (the odd tipsy university student notwithstanding). Figuring it’s probably due to their lack of knowledge, I have decided to help them out by clustering and comparing the top venues near each of our subway stations. "

    "We will be working mainly with two datasets for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, we need geolocation coordinates for Montreal’s 68 subway (or Metro) stations. The source for these coordinates is the City of Montreal’s Open Data Portal (http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset). More specifically we will be using their data set on “STM Bus and Subway lines (http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/stm-traces-des-lignes-de-bus-et-de-metro). Now unfortunately, they only make it available as a large .SHP Shapefile, so we are gong to have to do a lot of cleanup to make it workable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second dataset will be the venues information queried from Foursquare using the geolocation coordinates obtained above. Instead of focusing on quantity (i.e. concentration of venues in a location), we will be focusing on quality (i.e. what are the top venues in a location). We are, after all, trying to convince tourists to use our world-class public transport system instead of contributing to the summer gridlock – and what better way than to guide them to the best Metro stations, with the best venues?\n"
